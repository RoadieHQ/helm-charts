This repository contains all of RoadieHQ's public Helm charts.

For example, you can use the chart in the `backstage` directory to install a fully working
Backstage instance into Kubernetes.

## Using the charts

Typically, these charts can be installed in a pattern like this:

```shell
helm repo add roadie https://charts.roadie.io
helm install backstage roadie/backstage
```

They may require pre-requisites such as PostgreSQL databases to be set up before running
Helm (backstage does!).

## Releasing new chart versions

Merging to master will automatically run a GitHub action which packages and releases
new charts.

 1. Make changes to a chart in a branch and bump the chart version on that branch, 
 2. Package the chart with `helm package .`. Be sure to run `helm package` within the chart directory, not in the root diractory.
 3. **Do not** run `helm repo index`,
 4. Open a pull request against the master branch,
 5. Review the changes, merge the branch to master,
 6. The repo will be indexed automatically upon merge.
